        <h1 class=¨customfont¨ id="Context of this website.">Context of this website.</h1>

        <p class="customfont"> Cooking Technologies also known as the technology for cooking has evolved throughout the ages from in past time cooking outside with fire pits and whatever else (of low quality albeit)that can scavenged/gathered which were useful in ancient times but are now obsolete in modern times  along with being dangerous and detrimental to the development of the user,the environment around the user and their overall society as well.Today we have tools used to help cooking and they are assisting to many such as tiny temp spikes that are meat thermometers that help people read the temperature of their meat and how to cook them right and/or how to cook them to their preferred doneness to toaster ovens that help them prepare and cook smaller and small number course meals.The future of cooking technologies in my mind at least is one singular appliance that can do the work of an entire kitchen one that has all its appliances and all its crew members to the max.Parts A will talk about the past and present of cooking technologies while Part B will talk and reveal my envisioned idea for the future of cooking technologies.I can´t tell you what it will be but hereś a hint its name is of  an appliance that your mom and dad use the same appliance your mom uses for her meatloaf and your dad uses for his world famous breakfast pizza.</p>

            <h3 class=¨customfont¨>Part A1;the past of cooking technology</h3>

            <p class="customfont">In the past people have cooked outside in outdoor stoves,ovens,furnaces anything they can use for cooking(albeit low quality) whenever they scavenged,hunted or farmed up.while in the past it worked,in modern world it is incredibly obsolete and dangerous.One of the reasons is that outdoor cooking can lead to higher carbon diozide pollution which would punch holes into the oozne layer.A cause of this problem is that 2.3 billion people on earth out of the 8 billion people living on earth don´t have access to clean cooking.An effect of this issue is that 3.7 million people(mostly women and children) die from carbon dioxide posioning every year.Another effect is that women and female children who still use the unclean cooking methods often end up losing opprotunities in education which cause illiteracy rates to rise.A final consequence is that because of how long unclean cooking is most people who practice in it often lose employment very often.</p>

            <h3 class=¨customfont¨ id="Part A2;the present of cooking technology.">Part A2;the present of cooking technology.</h3>

            <p class="customfont">In the present day those who have access to cleaner forms of cooking would often find a variety of tools to help them in the process of making their food.Here are the tools that are well known for being used in cooking alot.Here are all of them;</p>

            <ul>
                        <li class=¨customfont¨>Non-stick frying pans are used for cooking greasy foods or sticky foods and are easy to wash too.</li>

                        <li class=¨customfont¨>A peeler is good for peeling any edibles that need peeling and is a much safer version than a knife.</li>

                        <li class=¨customfont¨>Sheet pans are multi use pans that are used  to bake and roast anything from big plump juicy chickens to tiny but perfectly crunchy nuts.</li>

                        <li class=¨customfont¨>A cast iron skillet is a tool that looks like the frying pan but unlike the latter it lasts for a lifetime and is multi functional as it can be used both on a stove and oven.</li>

                        <li class=¨customfont¨>Toaster oven is a basically miniature oven that people use to save power if they don't want to use a big oven and is better for cooking smaller products.</li>
                        <li class=¨customfont¨>Meat thermometers are spikes people use when cooking meats in order to cook them right.</li>

                        <li class=¨customfont¨>Box graters are tools in which people use to make shredded foods and can make the perfect hashbrowns.</li>

                        <li class=¨customfont¨>Citrus Squeezers are tools used when squeezing citrus fruits  and can keep the juice and seeds separate.</li>

                </ul>

         <h2 class=¨customfont¨ id="Part B ;The future of cooking technologies;The Ulti-Oven.">Part B ;The future of cooking technologies;The Ulti-Oven.</h2>

         <p class="customfont">My big idea for future cooking is the Ulti oven;a fully capable AI oven programmed by humans that makes you a full course meal including cold cold drinks and desserts.15 details/facts about the Ulti-oven;</p>

         <ul>

            <li class=¨customfont¨> 1:The ulti-oven shall use multiple components;The ulti oven would need multiple components in order to function properly and make the user the desired meal rather it be hot or cold,small or big or anything and everything the user desires from a slice of buttered toast to a tasty rotarise chicken with all the fixings on it.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>2:The person who programs it should be an expert in food and coding in order to prevent any and all future mishaps from happening when it comes to the operation of the machine.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>3:The machine while have a cold component for salads,cold appetizers,entrees,drinks,and desserts along with a room temperature component for snacks,a recycling comparnet for leftovers with its own hot and cold components  ,a hot component for hot appetizers,entrees,drinks,and desserts and finally a tray compartment for the tray of all the food that comes out of the machine.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>4:It works when somebody places in the ingredients for the meal they want,type in the instructions for the machine and let the magic happen with the ending being they get a delicious tasting meal and a high satisfaction for the invention.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>5:Seasoning for the consumables will either be placed in separate compartments,be placed in the desired and required compartments or be offered to the user in the tray and allow them to control the seasoning level.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>6:The machine will have a specifications bar that will allow the user to control how they want the food prepared from simple salt content to complex temperature control.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>7:Now the user can either put in the ingredients themselves or pay extra have the ulti oven connected to other kitchen appliances for removal of the extra work of manually loading the machine with ingredients but will require further coding due to the machine now needing to automatically pick and transport the required ingredients from their storage areas to the ulti-ovens compartments.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>8:Once done the oven will have an automatic cleaning system which will clean it internally or if the user wants to save a buck and time with the machine and its programing they can request for a version without the automatic cleaning system and do it themselves but when it comes to the internal cleaning system they must make sure the oven is stalked with cleaning supplies for the automatic cleaning system to work properly.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>9:The machine however will cost the same as operating a restaurant level kitchen for one month when it comes to the user’s rent but runs on any and all types of power including the rare static shocks of all objects of matter and living beings.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>10:And it will come with spare parts and the user most do a parts check through a online feature at least once a week and replace any parts that need replacement or the machine will malfunction however if it is much more serious the user needs to call the company and request for a maintenance mechanic and programer to come and fix the machine right.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>11:To be more specific the components for the machine will be that of all kitchen components no matter if they run on electricity or not.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>12:Due to its high cost and space customers will be requested if they can prepare a full room and power source for the ulti-oven.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>13:The AI in the oven will also know when it needs to take a rest and for how long , informing the user and shutting down for good if needed until it is ready to resume operations again.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>14:In addition it will need an entire shipping crate to be transported to the destinations the user wishes to send.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>15:It will be made out of tungsten,silicone rubber and peek plastic all of which have the highest melting points and are expensive to extract and convert into materials a part of its high cost.Ulti-ovens with cheaper materials will be available but will have less options than the more expensive ulti-oven.</li>

            <li class=¨customfont¨>16:The costumer can either order it as a whole or order it in pre assembled form and have a specilatist and programer come,assmble it and program it at home or any desired location for a considerable amount of money.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 class=¨customfont¨ id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

            <p class="customfont">In conclusion the past of cooking technologies have taught us lessons to consider for future times and why we shouldn do certain things often and why most people don´t do them often as explained by the negative effects in the pargraph of part A a1.While the present of cooking technologies have shown how far and safer we have came when it came to cooking technologies and cooking in general.As for what the future in cooking technologies and in generally cooking holds I can confindently say that my ulti-oven and other future cooking appliances would revolutionize cooking and cooking technologies forever.*laughs manically like an evil villain.*</p>

Topic:Cooking technologies

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Context:Cooking Technologies also known as the technology for cooking has evolved throughout the ages from in past time cooking outside with fire pits and whatever else (of low quality albeit)that can scavenged/gathered which were useful in ancient times but are now obsolete in modern times  along with being dangerous and detrimental to the development of the user,the environment around the user and their overall society as well.Today we have tools used to help cooking and they are assisting to many such as tiny temp spikes that are meat thermometers that help people read the temperature of their meat and how to cook them right and/or how to cook them to their preferred doneness to toaster ovens that help them prepare and cook smaller and small number course meals.The future of cooking technologies in my mind at least is one singular appliance that can do the work of an entire kitchen one that has all its appliances and all its crew members to the max.Parts A will talk about the past and present of cooking technologies while Part B will talk and reveal my envisioned idea for the future of cooking technologies.I can´t tell you what it will be but hereś a hint its name is of  an appliance that your mom and dad use the same appliance your mom uses for her meatloaf and your dad uses for his world famous breakfast pizza.
## Part A: existing technology
*                 <p>In the present day those who have access to cleaner forms of cooking would often find a variety of tools to help them in the process of making their food.Here are the tools that are well known for being used in cooking alot.Here are all of them;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-stick frying pans are used for cooking greasy foods or sticky foods and are easy to wash too.</li>
                        <li>A peeler is good for peeling any edibles that need peeling and is a much safer version than a knife.</li>
                        <li>Sheet pans are multi use pans that are used  to bake and roast anything from big plump juicy chickens to tiny but perfectly crunchy nuts.</li>
                        <li>A cast iron skillet is a tool that looks like the frying pan but unlike the latter it lasts for a lifetime and is multi functional as it can be used both on a stove and oven.</li>
                        <li>Toaster oven is a basically miniature oven that people use to save power if they don't want to use a big oven and is better for cooking smaller products.</li>
                        <li>Meat thermometers are spikes people use when cooking meats in order to cook them right.</li>
                        <li>Box graters are tools in which people use to make shredded foods and can make the perfect hashbrowns.</li>
                        <li>Citrus Squeezers are tools used when squeezing citrus fruits  and can keep the juice and seeds separate.</li>
                </ul>

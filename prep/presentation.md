## Process
* <p>Process:The use of CSS Variables or cascading styling sheet variables to make the website look more cook friendly and hours of research for learning on how cooking technologies have evolved,what are the current challenges faced by people when it comes to cooking and what the future may hold and one product from the future.</p>


## Conclusion
* <p>Conclusion:So while cooking may look modern right now remember the challenges people face when it comes to cooking and remember what the future may be or look like when it comes to cooking and remember my Ulti-oven.And shout out to CSS variables for helping me decorate my website I coun have done it without you and for all of you my wonderful viewers remember that CSS variables can be a greater helper for you when it comes to making websites.</p>

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"

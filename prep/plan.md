| Ekrar  | I like the details you put for the information on cooking. I didn´t know that 2.3 billion peooplle don´t have access to clean cooking  | Instead of having the full links on the Website Portal, you can shorten it by having a word that describes the site and then embed the link into it. 
|  Crystopher | I like the amount of details you put into the website. I had no idea there were a ton of steps for cooking a good meal. Very specific with text and headers.  | You can add more colors, make sections into their own separate space, input fonts, space text apart, make the proper links works so that it is a short text that links automatically to the websites.
| Cammi | I like your detailed information about the billions of people who do not have access to clean cooking supplies. | Your website can have more color, instead of being only white.

### In this entry of my blog I will talk about the tool which is CSS Variables which I chose for my freedom project which is the future of cooking technologies which would mainly feature my invention the ulti-oven the ultimate kitchen appliance which I dicussed about in the previous blog.So check it out in the link below.Now the reason I choose this specific tool was that i tried and tinkered with all three tools on pickcode.io and I tried all of them out in the css area of pickcode.io and the output for each one varied with CSS variables being my strongest,css grid layout being a normal strength and css flexbox being my worse strength.For more information based on these CSS tools visis these websites in the links below.

# Links below to teh CSS tool and their websites metioned above:

## How I tinkered with CSS variables:What I did was create a pickcode project and I got a paragraph from my ulti-oven blog from the previous entry and I used the CSS varaiables to give the webpage some razzle dazzling color and these links show the result:

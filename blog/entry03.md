# Entry 3:The Future of Cooking Technologies.
##### 1/1/2025

## In this entry of my blog we will be talkinmg about the furture of cookiong technologies answering the five Wś about cooking technologies and how will they impact the future of cooking.Below is what I gathered about the past present and future of cooking technologies and how they answer the five Wś about cooking technologies and how will they impact the future of cooking;
## TOPIC:Cooking

## Content: 
## Context:What is Cooking?
### Cooking is the creation of an edible in which a human can consume mostly without consequence.
### Cooking can go from toasting up bread slices with butter to making a complex turducken.
### Cooking is considered edible adult arts and crafts as you are making masterpieces and both cooking and art require skills that need between months sometimes even years of refining.
### Finally cooking is an essential life skill all people have in order to survive.
### Today we will be investigating current cooking technologies such as cooking over fires with old iron spits and using oven pans to cooking roasted chicken in a old oven to what future cooking technologies would look like such as 1st world nations using something like my Ulti-ovens in their big kitchens with them selling their older cooking appliances to 2nd and 3rd world nations which in turn modernizes the cooking capabilities of the second and third world nations leaving no person starving,sick or uneducated.
### The issue with present cooking technologies.
### First website/web page visited;https://www.iea.org/reports/a-vision-for-clean-cooking-access-for-all/graphic-differences-in-clean-cooking-technologies 
### After I visited the first web page I found a link to more pages of the website which contained links to even more web pages.
### The first page I read was;a vision for clean cooking access for all.
### https://www.iea.org/reports/a-vision-for-clean-cooking-access-for-all 
### This page can help people cook more cleanly meaning they can cook with more cleanliness..
### It raises the issue that not everyone has access to a modern cooking system meaning not everyone has a safe way to cook their food.
### It finally shows unclean cooking methods lead to higher carbon dioxide meaning pollution comes from more than one source.


#### After the previous web page I found a new one that shines light on a major but unrecognized global cooking issue.
#### The web page is called;Nearly one third of the world still relies on rudimentary cooking methods with grave consequences.
#### The link is ;https://www.iea.org/reports/a-vision-for-clean-cooking-access-for-all/executive-summary 
#### 2.3 billion people still don’t have access to modern and safe cooking technology which helps prevent many things both towards them and society.
#### High amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere because of this issue and other issues.
#### 3.7 million people(mostly women and children) die every year because of this lack of access to modern cooking techniques.
#### This results in women and girls losing their education meaning that illiteracy rates can and will be high.
#### And finally because of the time wasted on this, people can’t keep jobs, resulting in a total collapse of economies meaning cooking won’t save the economy.
#### Other web pages are:
#### https://www.iea.org/reports/a-vision-for-clean-cooking-access-for-all/graphic-differences-in-clean-cooking-technologies 

#### Cooking Technologies:Hardware part.
#### First web search;Basic kitchen/cooking tools and here is the link .
#### First web page:https://www.cooksmarts.com/cooking-guides/create-a-functional-kitchen/20-must-have-kitchen-tools/ 
#### After visiting the page I’ve gotten more information on tools for cooking and I also found:
#### Links to web pages for each specific cooking tool.
#### I also learned that all the tools mentioned on the list all have their own uses no matter how big or small they are and they range from tiny measuring spoons for measuring liquids and powders to massive stock pots.
#### Non-stick frying pans are used for cooking greasy foods or sticky foods and are easy to wash too.
#### A peeler is good for peeling any edibles that need peeling and is a much safer version than a knife.
#### Sheet pans are multi use pans that are used  to bake and roast anything from big plump juicy chickens to tiny but crunchy and perfectly nuts.
#### On the bottom of the first page there were links to three more pages with information on more things on cooking tools and I went to the second page where 1 manage to get information on more advanced cooking tools;some of these tools are and also here is the link ;
#### Link to the second page;https://www.cooksmarts.com/cooking-guides/create-a-functional-kitchen/25-essential-kitchen-tools-to-upgrade-your-kitchen/ .
#### A cast iron skillet is a tool that looks like the frying pan but unlike the latter it lasts for a lifetime and is multi functional as it can be used both on a stove and oven.
#### Toaster oven is a basically miniature oven that people use to save power if they don't want to use a big oven and is better for cooking smaller products.
#### Meat thermometers are spikes people use when cooking meats in order to cook them right.
#### Box graters are tools in which people use to make shredded foods and can make the perfect hashbrowns.
#### Citrus Squeezers are tools used when squeezing citrus fruits  and can keep the juice and seeds separate.
#### Other links to visit; https://www.cooksmarts.com/cooking-guides/create-a-functional-kitchen/pantry-essentials/ .
#### And this final one;https://www.cooksmarts.com/cooking-guides/create-a-functional-kitchen/kitchen-organization/
#### So overall here is the current status of cooking globally and while it seems fine it definitely needs improvement so what I will share below will be what improvements will be made to cooking.
#### The future of cooking technologies
#### Topic:The Ulti-Oven.
#### My big idea for future cooking is the Ulti oven;a fully capable AI oven programmed by humans that makes you a full course meal including cold cold drinks and desserts.
#### 15 details/facts about the Ulti-oven;
#### 1:The ulti-oven shall use multiple components;The ulti oven would need multiple components in order to function properly and make the user the desired meal rather it be hot or cold,small or big or anything and everything the user desires from a slice of buttered toast to a tasty rotarise chicken with all the fixings on it.
#### 2:The person who programs it should be an expert in food and coding in order to prevent any and all future mishaps from happening when it comes to the operation of the machine.
#### 3:The machine while have a cold component for salads,cold appetizers,entrees,drinks,and desserts along with a room temperature component for snacks,a recycling comparnet for leftovers with its own hot and cold components  ,a hot component for hot appetizers,entrees,drinks,and desserts and finally a tray compartment for the tray of all the food that comes out of the machine.
#### 4:It works when somebody places in the ingredients for the meal they want,type in the instructions for the machine and let the magic happen with the ending being they get a delicious tasting meal and a high satisfaction for the invention.
#### 5:Seasoning for the consumables will either be placed in separate compartments,be placed in the desired and required compartments or be offered to the user in the tray and allow them to control the seasoning level.
#### 6:The machine will have a specifications bar that will allow the user to control how they want the food prepared from simple salt content to complex temperature control.
#### 7:Now the user can either put in the ingredients themselves or pay extra have the ulti oven connected to other kitchen appliances for removal of the extra work of manually loading the machine with ingredients but will require further coding due to the machine now needing to automatically pick and transport the required ingredients from their storage areas to the ulti-ovens compartments.
#### 8:Once done the oven will have an automatic cleaning system which will clean it internally or if the user wants to save a buck and time with the machine and its programing they can request for a version without the automatic cleaning system and do it themselves but when it comes to the internal cleaning system they must make sure the oven is stalked with cleaning supplies for the automatic cleaning system to work properly.
#### 9:The machine however will cost the same as operating a restaurant level kitchen for one month when it comes to the user’s rent but runs on any and all types of power including the rare static shocks of all objects of matter and living beings.
#### 10:And it will come with spare parts and the user most do a parts check through a online feature at least once a week and replace any parts that need replacement or the machine will malfunction however if it is much more serious the user is to call the company and request for a maintenance mechanic and programer to come and fix the machine right.
#### 11:To be more specific the components for the machine will be that of all kitchen components no matter if they run on electricity or not.
#### 12:Due to its high cost and space customers will be requested if they can prepare a full room and power source for the ulti-oven
#### 13:The AI in the oven will also know when it needs to take a rest and for how long , informing the user and shutting down for good if needed until it is ready to resume operations again.
#### 14:In addition it will need an entire shipping crate to be transported to the destinations the user wishes to send.
#### 15:Finally it will be made out of tungsten,silicone rubber and peek plastic all of which have the highest melting points and are expensive to extract and convert into materials translate them into a part of its high cost.Ulti-ovens with cheaper materials will be available but will have less options than the more expensive ulti-ovens.
#### In conclusion, while my Ulti-Oven design still needs to cover some flaws and other descriptions need to be added and it may take at least another 25 years for it to come to fruition it would solve all the problems and cooking and be useful to everyone who likes to cook.
#### In the bottom here are the images of the machines that inspired my design and their urls.Spoiler alert:They are conveyor pizza ovens which is the closest thing I can find until the technology develops even further.
	#### Images and their urls;

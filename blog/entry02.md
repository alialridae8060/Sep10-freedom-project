## Why I chose cooking technologies for my freedom project.
The topic I chose for my freedom project was cooking technologies.I chose this topic as I am learning how to cook and i decided I would reaserch the technical side of cooking in order to maintain safety while cooking.In the beginning I didn't do much as I thought there wasn't much technology when it came to cooking and also due to my own lack of effort in reserach.But with a little push with my parents and my amazing teacher Mr.Muller I was able to find quite the bit of information when I worked on finding cooking hardware and now I will share my new information with all of you.In this blog you will see all of the information i wa able to find on cooking technology.
